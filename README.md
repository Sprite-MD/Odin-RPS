# Odin-RPS
Practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a game of Rock, Paper, Scissor on a web page.
Learning project is based on following The Odin Project:

https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/dom-manipulation

First iteration just used basic functions and loops to create the game and output result in the console.  
Second iteration added a GUI and used Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation to have the player click on the choice instead of typing it into the console.  
Also added a scoreboard and shows the result on the web page itself so players don't need to play in the console.

What I learned:  
JavaScript syntax through usage of functions and loops  
DOM manipulation -- adding in HTML tags, changing CSS styles, and applying events to buttons  

Possible To-dos:
Replace buttons with images instead  
Mobile friendly  
Animations for choice
